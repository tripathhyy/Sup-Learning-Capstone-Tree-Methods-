Supervised Learning Capstone Project - Tree Methods Focus"-
and is part of a project by Pierian Data Inc. The goal of the project is to create a predictive model to determine 
whether or not a customer will churn using tree-based methods.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Missing Data Check: Verified the absence of missing values using .isna().
Class Balance: Used a count plot to visualize the balance of the target variable (Churn).
Distribution Analysis:
Created box plots and violin plots to analyze the distribution of TotalCharges based on Churn status.
Analyzed TotalCharges per Contract type with Churn as a hue.
Correlation Analysis:
Converted categorical features to dummy variables for correlation analysis.
Focused on a selected set of features to determine their correlation with the target variable.
Visualized correlations using a bar plot.
Churn Analysis:
Contract Types: Investigated different contract types available.
Tenure Analysis:
Created histograms to visualize the distribution of customer tenure.
Further segmented histograms by Churn status and Contract type to identify patterns.
Planned Next Steps:
The structure suggests a move towards model building, likely focusing on tree-based methods like decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
Project Description:
Title: Customer Churn Prediction Using Tree-Based Methods

Description:
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using supervised learning techniques, focusing on tree-based methods. The dataset "Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" is used, containing various customer attributes such as demographics, service usage, and contract information.

The project involves:

Data Exploration: Handling missing data, visualizing distributions, and analyzing feature correlations.
Churn Analysis: Investigating patterns based on contract types, tenure, and other features.
Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating tree-based models to predict if a customer will churn.
